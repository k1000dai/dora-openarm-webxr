# dora-openarm-webxr

A [dora-rs](https://dora-rs.ai) node that reads the pose and
controller state of a VR device such as Meta Quest 3 or PICO 4 through
[WebXR](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API)
and publishes them to a dora-rs dataflow. You can use it for OpenArm
teleoperation with a VR device.

## Install

```bash
pip install dora-openarm-webxr
```

## Setup

This dora-rs node starts a Web server because WebXR runs as JavaScript
in the Web browser on a VR device. The VR device connects to this
server to stream its pose and controller state.

WebXR requires HTTPS, so this dora-rs node needs a certificate. A
self-signed certificate is enough because the dora-rs node and the VR
device communicate only within your local network. You can generate
one with
[`example/prepare_tls.sh`](example/prepare_tls.sh):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/enactic/dora-openarm-webxr.git
cd dora-openarm-webxr
example/prepare_tls.sh ${YOUR_HOST_NAME}
```

Replace `${YOUR_HOST_NAME}` with a host name that your VR device can
resolve. A `.local` host name configured automatically by Avahi is a
convenient choice. You can check whether your `.local` host name is
available with the following command:

```bash
avahi-resolve --name $(hostname).local
```

If it resolves to your host's IP address, you can generate the
self-signed certificate with the following command line:

```bash
example/prepare_tls.sh $(hostname).local
```

This writes `server.crt` and `server.key` (and the `root.*` files used
to sign them) into the `example/` directory.

You can run
[`example/dataflow_mujoco.yaml`](example/dataflow_mujoco.yaml) with the
generated self-signed certificate by the following command lines:

```bash
pip install dora-rs-cli
dora build example/dataflow_mujoco.yaml
TLS_CERTIFICATE_FILE=server.crt TLS_KEY_FILE=server.key dora run example/dataflow_mujoco.yaml
```

Open http://localhost:8000/ on the local machine for
[dora-openarm-data-collection-ui](https://github.com/enactic/dora-openarm-data-collection-ui).

Open `https://$(hostname).local:8443/` in the Web browser on your VR
device, not in the browser on your local machine. Because the
certificate is self-signed, the Web browser shows a security
warning. You can continue to the page from its "Advanced" options.

Press the "Start" button on the page to start teleoperation with your
VR device.

## Debug

You can use [Immersive Web
Emulator](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/immersive-web-emulator/cgffilbpcibhmcfbgggfhfolhkfbhmik)
and Chrome to debug this node without a VR device.

## Outputs

This dora-rs node outputs the following data. Pose, trigger and
joystick outputs are sent on each `frame` message received from the VR
device. Button outputs are sent only when the corresponding button is
included in a `frame` message.

## Command line options

You can configure this dora-rs node by the following command line
options. Each option also has a corresponding environment variable
that is used as the default value. Setting the environment variable is
useful in a dora-rs dataflow YAML.
